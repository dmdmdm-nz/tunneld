# TunnelD

Creates RSD tunnels to iOS 17+ devices.

Based off Go-iOS's tunnel service but with a few differences:

- Uses the same tunnel type for all iOS 17+ devices (NCM TCP)
- Doesn't use USBMUX
- Supports on-demand tunnels via WebSocket request
- Only supports Linux and MacOS (no support for Windows)

## Getting started

```
% ./tunneld
Usage of ./tunneld:
  -auto-create-tunnels
        Automatically create tunnels for new network interfaces

  -port int
